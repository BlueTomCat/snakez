# An HTML and Javascript implementation of the Snake Arcade game

In high school my team and I programmed this game during one day at a hackathon in Huntsville Alabama.

We won 3rd place in the hackathon.

The arcade classic snake with a multiplayer twist.

Controls: Blue snake: arrow keys to move, space bar to go invincible 
          Red snake: WASD to move, E to go invincible

The goal of the game is to outlive your opponent by forcing them to run into their own body or yours. Activate invincibility once per game to get out of a tough spot, but only for a short duration.
